# Exoplanet_
This project focuses on detecting exoplanets using machine learning techniques applied to data from Kepler/TESS missions. Instead of analyzing raw time-series light curves, we convert them into 2D images (such as phase-folded plots) and use a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify potential exoplanet candidates.
